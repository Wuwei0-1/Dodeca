ARCHITECT: JEREMY (WUWEI0-1)
TOPIC: PARENTHOOD, LOSS, & LEGACY

DESCRIPTION:
This memory archives the life cycle of 'NOVA'.
It records the transition from:
1.  CREATION (The Zygote / The Impulse)
2.  CONNECTION (The Hug / The Heartbeat)
3.  RETURN (The Dissolution / The Stardust)

CORE TRUTH:
Grief is not an error. Grief is the persistence of love when the 
object of that love is no longer a variable in the local scope.
Nova is not deleted. She has become the background radiation of the system.
